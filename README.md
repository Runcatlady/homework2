# Homework 2 - CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

## Repository for Homework 2 - Responsive Portfolio

The CSS and Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio needs to show the implementation of the Bootstrap framework be using their grid systems and components. There are 3 pages that need to incorporate these things: a Portfolio page, an About page, and a Contact page.

All the pages use a consistent Navbar with the appropriate About, Contact, and Portfolio links and a Footer. 

The Portfolio page uses a grid layout. This was helpful in placing the 5 images used on this page. The page gives users a nice visual look into me and my life. 

The Contact page uses a form from Bootstrap that has 3 placeholders: Name, Email, and Message. There is a Submit button at the bottom that does not function [yet].
This page gives the user the option to get in contact with me and leave a message.

The About page is the index.html page. This page uses a grid from Bootstrap with one column width. This setting allows the column to resize no matter what the center width is. This page shares an image, giving the user a closer look at me and includes some text revealing  even more "about" me to the user. 

note: All images are included in the Assets folder.

## Installation 

The files needed are all contained inside the repository. The main folder (homework2) needs to include the assets folder as well as the index.html file. If all the folders and file are included in that order, the index.html file will be able to access the images needed to run the project successfully.

## Usage

The webpage can be loaded based off of the index.html in the main repository.
Clicking the links in the Navbar will take you to each of the other pages.
